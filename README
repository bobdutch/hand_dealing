= About
Deal Hand is a ruby a console app that will first
prompt the user for the number of players in a card game.  Then it
will prompt the user for the number of cards to deal each player.
After that, it will simply print out the cards dealt to each player.

= Running The Application
The Deal Hand application requires that you have ruby in your path.
It has been tested on OSX with ruby 1.8.7 and ruby 1.9.2.
It does not require any libraries outside of the ruby standard library


To Run, change directory to hand_dealing (from where the source was extracted) and run
  ruby deal_hand.rb

Also it could be run from other directories ex.
  cd ..
  ruby hand_dealing/deal_hand.rb
or if the file is executable
  ./deal_hand.rb

The program will prompt you to enter the number of players and
number of cards per hand. If valid input is given it will print
the hands dealt to the players to standard out.
  * It will reprompt if invalid values are entered
    ex. (0, non-numerical values).
  * Input is cast to an integer
    ex. ("1.5" would become 1, "2 foo" becomes 2)
  * There is no limit to the number of players or cards per hand.
    Cards are dealt one at a time to the players starting with seat one.
    Therefore, if the number of players multiplied by the number of
    cards per hand is greater than 52 then the players will start with
    an uneven amount of cards 


= Running The Tests
tests are in the test/ directory.
You can run the test cases individually eg.
  ruby test/tc_player.rb
or run the test suite which runs all of the test cases
  ruby test/ts_all.rb
