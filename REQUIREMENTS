Weâ€™d like you to design and implement a small "Hand Dealing" program in
a language of your choice.  We'll be looking for well-designed,
robust and maintainable code.  We're not necessarily looking for
extensibility, so you don't need to worry about allowing plugins or
configuration options, or anything of that sort.

The program is pretty simple.  It's a console app that will first
prompt the user for the number of players in a card game.  Then it
will prompt the user for the number of cards to deal each player.
After that, it will simply print out the cards dealt to each player.
Here is a sample run of the program:

Enter the number of players: 6
Enter the number of cards in a hand: 4
Seat 1: Qd, 4h, 3c, 4c
Seat 2: 9c, Qs, 9s, 7s
Seat 3: 7c, Qc, Ac, Ah
Seat 4: As, 2h, 3s, 3d
Seat 5: 6h, 7d, Kd, 5s
Seat 6: Qh, 8c, Ts, 9h
Some Things To Note

Suits should be represented with a single letter
(c, d, h, s).  Ranks should be represented with a number for 2-9, T
for ten, JQK for royalty, and A for Ace.
