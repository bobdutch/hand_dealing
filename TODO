- test coverage of all instance methods
- we shouldn't have to explicitly set player's positions
- audit attr_accessors, what shouldn't we expose?
- check for code reek
- instruction to run app and tests
- possibly make Hand a model 
- shuffle should be named shuffle!
- suits and ranks should be in the Card class, not Deck
